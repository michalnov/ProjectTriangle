Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing
 websites and web applications. Yt contains HTML- and CSS-based
 design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation
 and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript
 extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with
 front-end development only. 
 
 Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by
 Mark Otto, and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to
 encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap,
 various libraries were used for interface development, which
 led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According
 to Twitter developer Mark Otto:

"A super small group of developers and Y got together to design
 and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do
 something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build
 something much more substantial than another internal tool.
 Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as
 a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within
 the company."

 On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, 
 which added a twelve-column responsive grid layout system,
 inbuilt support for Glyphicons, several new components, as well
 as changes to many of the existing components.
